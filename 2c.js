//2c. Reversing an array: Arrays have a reverse method which changes the array by inverting the order in which its elements appear. For this exercise, write a function, reverseArray. The reverseArray, takes an array as argument and produces a new array that has the same elements in the inverse order. Without reverse method.


function reverseArray(arr) {
    let reverseArr = [];
    while (arr.length) {
      reverseArr.push(arr.pop());
    }
  
    return reverseArr;
  }
  
  console.log(reverseArray(['A','B','C']));
